## Playing the Game
Currently, we have an inVision mockup of most essential game screens and a quick implementation of these screens. The calculations for scoring the game and available moves are all in an excel sheet, awaiting implementation. They can be found   [Here](https://docs.google.com/a/dali.dartmouth.edu/spreadsheets/d/1wtk2EAtEfLXUmhWB8FaaP5jYiC496GdiOfV2iDdhd_o/edit?usp=sharing)

## Architecture

We intend to use Unity. All assets will be stored in the Assets folder

Tools and libraries: Unity 2D, Firebase

## Setup

Open the base directory as a Unity project

## Deployment

##### Deployment for iOS:
> - Build for iOS
> - Sign code
> - Archive project
> - Upload

##### Deployment for Android:
> - Build for Android
> - Open in Android Studio
> - Deploy for Android…

## TODO:

##### Design:
> - Another iteration of stat icons
> - Mockups of the less integral pages (level selection, unlockables, etc)
> - Mockups of unlockables
> - Mockups of achievements

##### Develop:
> - backend implementation (scoring formulas, saved games, users, etc)
> - implementation of latest mockups
> - An in-game tutorial

##### Other:
> - A paper set of instructions on how to play the game
> - replacing placeholder game content with actual game content
